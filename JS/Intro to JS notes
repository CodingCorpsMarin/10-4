Javascript is a mainly object-based scripting language
It is NOT Java. It has nothing to do with Java except for the name
Focused on client-side (browser) operations
Supported data-types: number, string, boolean, function, object, symbol
Older language, so the syntax is more rigid (for example, everything ends with a semi-colon)
Important feature: create new functions (methods in Ruby)
The new web is built on javascript, from jQuery to React
Currently, javascriptâ€™s incredible versatility in creating new functions and components makes it popular for new web frameworks
