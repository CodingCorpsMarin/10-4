Let’s get started with Javascript:

Open a js repl 
https://repl.it/languages/javascript

console.log() is the equivalent to Ruby’s “print/puts/p”

Try telling your code to say “Hello World!”

console.log("Hello World!");

Comments are /* */

Just like Ruby, you can console.log() anything: strings, numbers, booleans, math operations, etc
console.log(24+12);
console.log(true);
console.log(‘Tacos’);


Just like Ruby, you can call object functions (class methods). For example: console.log(‘Tacos’.length) 

Javascript has several built-in functions you can use, for a list, check this: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_builtin_functions.htm

Functions are called like this:
console.log(‘Tacos’.toUpperCase());
The structure of a function is the name (case sensitive!) and the argument (what’s inside the parentheses). Many times, there will be no arguments, we still need to include the parentheses.

JS has arrays and hashes, just like Ruby, they are declared like this:
var books = ['harry potter', 'twilight', 'the bible']

var stands for “variable”, you are declaring that there is a variable called “books”
JS has built-in array functions you can use just like Ruby as well
console.log(books);
books.push('1984');
console.log(books);

This should be enough to get you started on some simple JS exercises
